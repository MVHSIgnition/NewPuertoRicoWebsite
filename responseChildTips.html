          <strong>10 Tips to Help Kids Cope with Disasters</strong>
          <ul>
           <li>Limit TV time : Intense media coverage of disasters can frighten young children and disturb teenagers.</li>
           <li> Listen : Find out your child&#8217;s concerns about the situation. Children often cannot give meaning to a dangerous situation. Begin a dialogue to help them gain a basic understanding that&#8217;s appropriate for their age.</li>
           <li> Comfort : Let them know their safety is your top priority.</li>
           <li> Be Aware : Changes in routine behaviors, such as sleeping pattern or eating habits, can indicate distress. Seek professional support if they persist.</li>
           <li> Expect the unexpected : As children develop, their intellectual, physical and emotional capacities change.</li>
           <li> Make time : Help kids understand they are safe and secure by talking, playing and engaging in bonding family activities.</li>
           <li> Keep calm and carry on : Your child will learn how to deal with these events from you and will model his or her behavior after yours.</li>
           <li> Care : Make a point of showing sensitivity toward other families impacted by the disaster. This is an opportunity to teach your children that we all need to help each other.</li>
           <li> Routine : Help your children return to normal activities including school, sports and play groups.</li>
           <li> Volunteer : Helping others can give your child a sense of control, security and empathy.
           </li>
